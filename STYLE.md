# Style 

For me personally the most important style things are:
- make sure you use snake- or camel case and not both of them
- make sure you choose logical function names 
- always use the same quotation marks " " or ''
- make sure that the indentation of the javascript code is consistent 
- make sure the function to draw graphs are build up in more or less the same way
- ...
This is all I know for now
