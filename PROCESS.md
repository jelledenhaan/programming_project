# day 1

Today I have been working on my line graph. I was very difficult to create this graph, since I use version 3 of d3 and previously I used version 4. 
It was also difficult to extract the right data from the right json file. After a couple of hours I managed to extract the right data and create a line. However, the line did not corresponds with the data. In the end everything did correspond and the line corresponded with the data. The basics of the line graph are complete, the line graph only needs to be styled properly

# day 2

Today I did not do very much work due to illness. I decided to leave school earlier because I felt not good. I managed to write the API request and save the data in a global variable. With this data the scatterplot and pie chart can be made easily. 


# day 3 
Today I have work on my scatterplot, the basics of this scatterplot are almost finished. The only thing that needs to be done is the y-axis which is a little bit difficult. The scatterplot also needs to be styled nicely. The styling of the graphs is a task that I will do this weekend.
