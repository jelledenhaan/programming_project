# day 1

Today I have been working on my line graph. I was very difficult to create this graph, since I use version 3 of d3 and previously I used version 4. 
It was also difficult to extract the right data from the right json file. After a couple of hours I managed to extract the right data and create a line. However, the line did not corresponds with the data. In the end everything did correspond and the line corresponded with the data. The basics of the line graph are complete, the line graph only needs to be styled properly

# day 2

Today I did not do very much work due to illness. I decided to leave school earlier because I felt not good. I managed to write the API request and save the data in a global variable. With this data the scatterplot and pie chart can be made easily. 


# day 3 
Today I have work on my scatterplot, the basics of this scatterplot are almost finished. The only thing that needs to be done is the y-axis which is a little bit difficult. The scatterplot also needs to be styled nicely. The styling of the graphs is a task that I will do this weekend. 

# day 4
This day I started with my donut chart, I wrote some code but the data was not shown in the donut chart. There was some kind of error where my data was undefined. The donut chart is not finished yet but the basics of the code are already there. 

# day 5
I continued with the donut chart and finally I managed to figure out what the problem with my data was. The donut chart can now be seen on the website.The style of the donut chart is far from finished and the lay out could be better. As I already said before, this weekend I will try to focus on the style of the graphs. 

# 22-01-2017 and 23-01-2017

Focused on donut styling of the graphs. I find it difficult to connect the css parts to the right parts of the graphs. After a couple of questions I managed to style the graphs properly. Furthermore it was difficult to color the graphs but and the end I was able to do it. 

# 23-01-2017 and 24-01-2017

Started with the interactivity of the scatterplot. I wanted to adjust the axis and variables of both the x and y axis. I struggled to write an update function for the scatterplot. The most difficult part was to get clear which part should be in the initialization function and which part should be in the update function. I got help from a fellow student and a student teacher. They explained me the basic concept of the update function and after a long time the scatterplot was finally interactive. 

# 25-01-2017 

This day I wanted to make the donutchart interactive in combination with the dropdown which controls the scatterplot as well. I just wanted to do the update function this time all by myself. It was very difficult because there was no clear example on the internet. At the end of the day I managed to write an update function and the donutchart was interactive. 

# 26-01-2017
Started with the update function of the linegraph. It was difficult because the linegraph function needed many input arguments. I struggled to change this and made a beginning with it.

# 29-01-2017
Finished the linegraph, finally managed to change the line of the graph. And added a legend and axes titles. 

# 30-01-2017
Created a function that the line graph updates when the user clicks on a piece of the donutchart or on a dot of the scatterplot. Added some style things to the scatterplot which caused a minor bug. The dots were dissapearing but at the end of the day it was all normal.

# 31-01-2017
Added an info button on my webpage, when the user click on that button, there will be an explanation of the webpage and a short manual. Fixed another bug in my donutchart. The donutchart stroke wasn't update properly, it had to do with the id i gave to the pieces. After I got some help from an assistent I managed to fix the bug

# 01-02-2017
Fixed the report and updated the readme. The hardest part of today was cleaning up my code. I had many console.logs and commented code in my code so I deleted them and commented my code.
