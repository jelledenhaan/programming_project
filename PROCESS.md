# day 1

Today I have been working on my line graph. I was very difficult to create this graph, since I use version 3 of d3 and previously I used version 4. 
It was also difficult to extract the right data from the right json file. After a couple of hours I managed to extract the right data and create a line. However, the line did not corresponds with the data. In the end everything did correspond and the line corresponded with the data. The basics of the line graph are complete, the line graph only needs to be styled properly
